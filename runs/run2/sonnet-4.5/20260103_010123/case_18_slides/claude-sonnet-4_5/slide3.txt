Types of Machine Learning
There are three main types of ML approaches:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Training with labeled data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through trial and error
   - Examples: Game AI, Robotics
