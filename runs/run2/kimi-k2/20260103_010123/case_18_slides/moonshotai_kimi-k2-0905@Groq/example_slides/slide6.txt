Overfitting and Underfitting
============================
Overfitting:
- Model learns training data too well
- Poor generalization to new data
- Solutions: Regularization, cross-validation

Underfitting:
- Model too simple for the data
- High bias, low variance
- Solutions: More complex model, more features

The Goal: Find the right balance!
