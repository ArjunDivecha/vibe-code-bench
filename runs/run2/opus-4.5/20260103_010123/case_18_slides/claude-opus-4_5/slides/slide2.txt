Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example pairs.
This is the most widely used type of machine learning in practice.
