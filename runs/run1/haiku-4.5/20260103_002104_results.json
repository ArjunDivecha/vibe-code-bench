            "score": 9,
            "reason": "Code is syntactically correct with no runtime errors. All JavaScript functions are properly defined, event handlers are correctly attached, and localStorage operations are handled safely. The only minor issue is relying on event.target in switchView without the event parameter being passed, but this works due to global event object in most browsers."

          "features_complete": {
            "score": 9,
            "reason": "All required features are implemented: glassmorphism styling with blurred backgrounds, vertical sidebar with active/hover states, all 4 required widgets (Active Projects with progress bars, Recent Activity timeline, Quick Links grid, Task List with checkboxes), view switching without reload, New Project modal, and localStorage persistence. Includes bonus features like task deletion and settings page."
          },
          "output_quality": {
            "score": 9,
            "reason": "The dashboard looks and feels premium as requested. Glassmorphism effects are well-implemented, animations are smooth, the interface is responsive and polished. Progress bars animate correctly, tasks persist across sessions, and the modal interaction is clean. The overall aesthetic matches a high-end native desktop application."

            "score": 10,
            "reason": "Followed specifications exactly - single HTML file with pure CSS/JS, no external dependencies. Implemented all requested features precisely as specified: glassmorphism aesthetics, vertical sidebar, all 4 widgets, view switching, modal for new projects, and localStorage persistence. Did not add unwanted frameworks or deviate from requirements."

            "reason": "Well-organized code with clear separation of concerns. Good use of constants for storage keys, proper data management functions, and clean rendering logic. Includes error prevention (escapeHtml for XSS protection) and user confirmation for destructive actions. Minor deduction for the event parameter issue in switchView and some repetitive CSS that could be consolidated."
          },
          "elegance": {
            "score": 8,
            "reason": "Elegant solutions throughout: smooth animations using CSS transitions and keyframes, clever use of CSS gradients for text effects, clean data persistence pattern, and thoughtful UX touches like hover states and micro-animations. The glassmorphism implementation is particularly well done with proper backdrop filters and layered transparency effects."
