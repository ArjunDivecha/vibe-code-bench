Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

These approaches form the foundation of modern AI applications.
