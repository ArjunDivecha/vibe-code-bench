Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the dataset.

Key techniques:
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Anomaly detection
- Association rule learning

Applications: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, data compression
