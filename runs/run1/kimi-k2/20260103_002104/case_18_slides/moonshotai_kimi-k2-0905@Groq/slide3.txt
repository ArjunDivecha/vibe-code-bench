Types of Machine Learning
There are three main categories of machine learning algorithms, each suited for different types of problems and data.

1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled examples
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Each type has its own set of algorithms and applications, which we'll explore in detail.
