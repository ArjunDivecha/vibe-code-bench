What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Core principle: Instead of writing explicit rules, we feed data to algorithms that can learn patterns and make predictions.

The learning process involves:
1. Training on historical data
2. Identifying patterns and relationships
3. Making predictions on new, unseen data
4. Continuously improving performance
