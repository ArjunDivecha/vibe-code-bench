Getting Started with ML
Starting your machine learning journey requires understanding both theory and practical implementation.

Essential tools and libraries:
- Python (programming language)
- scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning)
- Jupyter Notebooks (interactive development)

Next steps: Practice with real datasets, participate in Kaggle competitions, build personal projects
