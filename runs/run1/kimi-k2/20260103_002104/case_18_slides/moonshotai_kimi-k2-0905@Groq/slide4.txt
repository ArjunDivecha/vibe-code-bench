Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data where each example includes both input features and the correct output (label).

Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression (continuous outputs)
- Logistic Regression (classification)
- Decision Trees (interpretable rules)
- Neural Networks (complex patterns)

Use cases: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis, price prediction
