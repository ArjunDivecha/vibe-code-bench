Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Key components:
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world the agent interacts with
- Actions: Choices available to the agent
- Rewards: Feedback for good/bad actions

Examples: Game playing (Chess, Go), robotics, autonomous vehicles
