JavaScript is modular with separate functions for rendering different components. Proper event delegation and localStorage error handling. Some functions could be more DRY (repeated HTML generation), but overall very readable and maintainable."

The animated background mesh and glassmorphism effects create a genuinely premium feel. Code structure is intuitive and the UI interactions feel polished."
