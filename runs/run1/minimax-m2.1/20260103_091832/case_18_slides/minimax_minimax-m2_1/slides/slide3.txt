Neural Networks Fundamentals

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological brains that recognize patterns and make decisions.

Structure:
- Input Layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden Layers: Process information
- Output Layer: Delivers predictions

Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
