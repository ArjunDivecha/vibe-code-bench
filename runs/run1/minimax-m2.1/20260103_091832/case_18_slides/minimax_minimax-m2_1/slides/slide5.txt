Best Practices for ML Projects

1. Data Quality: Garbage in, garbage out
2. Feature Engineering: Domain knowledge matters
3. Cross-validation: Validate your models properly
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize for performance
5. Model Deployment: Consider scalability and maintenance

Conclusion: Start simple, iterate often.
