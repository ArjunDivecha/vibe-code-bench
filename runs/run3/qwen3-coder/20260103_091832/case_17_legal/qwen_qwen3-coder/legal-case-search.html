Smith v. Johnson, No. S234567

Argued: March 10, 2023
Decided: May 15, 2023

OPINION

CHIEF JUSTICE CORRIGAN delivered the opinion of the court.

This case presents the question of what duty, if any, a property owner owes to a person who enters the owner's land without permission. Plaintiffs Robert Smith and his minor daughter, Emily Smith, appeal from a judgment of nonsuit entered in favor of defendant property owner, William Johnson.

I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On the evening of January 15, 2022, Robert Smith and his 12-year-old daughter, Emily, were walking home from a friend's house when they decided to take a shortcut through what they believed was an abandoned lot. In reality, the lot was owned by defendant William Johnson, who had purchased it the previous year with plans to build a residential development.

As the Smiths crossed the lot, Emily fell into an uncovered excavation approximately four feet deep. She sustained a broken arm and required hospitalization. The excavation had been dug months earlier by a contractor hired by Johnson to prepare the site for construction. Johnson had been told the excavation would be covered, but the contractor had failed to do so.

The Smiths filed suit, alleging that Johnson had negligently failed to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition. The trial court granted Johnson's motion for nonsuit, finding that he owed no duty to the trespassing Smiths. The Court of Appeal affirmed, and we granted review.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Duty of Care to Trespassers

The question before us is whether a property owner owes a duty of care to persons who enter the owner's land without permission. For over a century, California law has followed the common law rule that property owners generally owe no duty to trespassers...

OPINION

McKEOWN, Circuit Judge:

Carlos Rodriguez appeals his conviction for illegal re-entry after deportation, challenging the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained at an interior border checkpoint. We affirm.

I. BACKGROUND

Rodriguez was driving a vehicle registered to his brother and was unable to produce a valid driver's license...

Anderson v. City of Portland

(S067890)

Argued: November 15, 2022
Decided: January 30, 2023

Before: LINDER, BALMER, and DE MUNIZ, Justices.

BALMER, J.

This case requires us to determine the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance requiring permits for public demonstrations and the city's denial of a permit for a spontaneous demonstration. We conclude that the ordinance is facially constitutional but that, as applied to the facts of this case, it violated plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff Mark Anderson and several other individuals planned to hold a demonstration in downtown Portland on July 4, 2021, to protest the city's handling of homelessness. The demonstration was planned after learning on July 2 of a city council vote that morning to approve a new homeless services policy...
