In this case, the defendant was charged with multiple counts of fraud related to unauthorized access to digital financial records. The primary issue before the court was whether law enforcement's acquisition of data from a third-party cloud service provider constituted a 'search' under the Fourth Amendment. The court found that individuals maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their digital communications, even when stored with third parties. The ruling established that law enforcement must obtain a warrant based on probable cause before compelling third-party providers to disclose private digital communications. This decision has significant implications for digital privacy rights and law enforcement procedures in the digital age."

                fullText: "CLARK, et al., Petitioners, v. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, Respondent. United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitioners challenged the FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which repealed net neutrality rules. The court upheld the FCC's conclusion that it lacked authority to impose common carrier obligations on broadband providers. However, the court vacated portions of the order that preempted state net neutrality laws, finding that the FCC failed to provide adequate justification for such preemption. The decision clarifies the boundaries of federal and state authority over internet regulation."

Plaintiffs, representing businesses closed during the pandemic, brought claims for business interruption coverage under various commercial insurance policies.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that most policies required direct physical loss or damage to property, which viral contamination does not constitute. The court emphasized that courts must enforce insurance contracts as written, even during unprecedented circumstances. The decision has significant implications for pandemic-related insurance coverage disputes."
