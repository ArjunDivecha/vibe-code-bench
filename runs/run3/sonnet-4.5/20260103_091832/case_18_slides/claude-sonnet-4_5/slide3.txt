Resource Allocation Strategy
Efficient resource management is critical for project success.

Resource Types:
• Human resources (team members, skills)
• Financial resources (budget, funding)
• Technical resources (tools, equipment)
• Time resources (schedules, deadlines)

Balance availability with requirements to optimize outcomes.
