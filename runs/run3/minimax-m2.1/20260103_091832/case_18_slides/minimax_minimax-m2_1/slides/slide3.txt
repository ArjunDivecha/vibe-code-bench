Control Flow Statements
Control flow manages the execution order of code

CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:
if - Execute code if condition is true
elif - Check additional conditions
else - Execute when all conditions fail

LOOPING STRUCTURES:
for loops - Iterate over sequences
while loops - Repeat while condition is true
break - Exit loop immediately
continue - Skip to next iteration

BEST PRACTICES:
Keep loops simple and focused
Avoid deep nesting
Use enumerate() when needing index
Consider list comprehensions for simple transformations
