The automated aggregation and analysis of biometric identifiers—particularly when conducted at scale—implicate fundamental dignity interests protected by our state constitution.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the trial court's admission of the challenged evidence.\n\nDissent (Cuéllar, J.): The majority's ruling will hinder law enforcement's ability to combat serious crime in public spaces...`

The Court, by a vote of 5-2, reverses the order of the Appellate Division.\n\nOpinion by Fahey, J.:\n\nWe conclude that the government's acquisition of decrypted message content—after messages were delivered but stored in encrypted form on a third-party server—constitutes an electronic eavesdropping under the statute. The user's expectation that only intended recipients can access message content is not extinguished upon delivery when the messages remain encrypted and inaccessible to the provider under normal circumstances.\n\nThe act of compelling decryption bypasses the intended security architecture and amounts to real-time interception in practical effect, even if technically delayed.\n\nConcurrence (Wilson, J.): I write separately to emphasize that this decision does not bar lawful access pursuant to a warrant under CPL 700...`

Jane Johnson, a graduate student, alleges that she was subjected to severe and pervasive sexual harassment by a fellow student during online coursework and virtual study groups. She claims the university failed to respond adequately, in violation of Title IX.\n\nWe must decide whether Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in education extends to harassment occurring in virtual learning environments.\n\nWe hold that it does. The statute applies to all educational activities receiving federal financial assistance, and there is no basis to exclude digital spaces that serve as functional equivalents of physical classrooms.\n\nThe university’s motion to dismiss is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.`

Petitioner challenges the City’s determination that the project qualifies for an exemption under OAR 340-019-0010(2)(a).\n\nWe hold that the exemption does not apply where a project may result in substantial adverse effects on historic resources listed in the National Register. The term 'environmental' in the Oregon Environmental Policy Act must be interpreted broadly to include cultural and historic resources.\n\nThe Court of Appeals’ decision affirming the City’s exemption is reversed.`

A person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their real-time physical movements as revealed by wireless signals broadcast from a personal device. The pervasive and indiscriminate data collection inherent in IMSI-catchers amplifies privacy risks beyond those of traditional surveillance.\n\nThe appellate court’s judgment suppressing the evidence is affirmed.\n\nDissent (Theis, J.): The majority’s decision ignores the third-party doctrine and will impede law enforcement’s ability to respond to time-sensitive investigations...`

TechForward appeals the district court’s dismissal of its patent infringement claims under Rule 12(b)(6), holding that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,876,543 are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\nWe affirm. The claims recite the abstract idea of verifying authenticity using timestamped records. The use of blockchain technology, while novel, does not supply an inventive concept sufficient to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible application. The specification describes the blockchain as a generic component used in a conventional manner.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the claims are not directed to patent-eligible subject matter.`

This case presents the constitutional implications of using artificial intelligence to reconstruct a defendant’s voice from fragmented audio clips collected from social media.\n\nAppellant challenges the admission of a synthetic voice sample generated by a deep learning model trained on his public posts. The prosecution did not disclose the model architecture or training dataset.\n\nWe hold that the Confrontation Clause requires disclosure of material information affecting the reliability of forensic AI-generated evidence. The inability to cross-examine the methodology or data used to train the model deprived Appellant of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the evidence.\n\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.`

Appellant, a delivery driver, argues that he is an employee under the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act, not an independent contractor.\n\nWe apply the common law right to control test. Despite the contract labeling drivers as independent contractors, Appellee exercises significant control: it sets delivery fees, mandates app usage, enforces dress codes and vehicle standards, and deactivates drivers for low ratings.\n\nWe conclude that Appellant has established a prima facie case of employee status. The arbitration clause, which applies only to contractors, is inapplicable. The trial court’s order is reversed and remanded.`

Defendant, a cybersecurity researcher, accessed a publicly available government database to test for vulnerabilities. Though the database’s terms prohibited automated scraping, Defendant argues his actions were for public benefit.\n\nThe issue is whether violating terms of service transforms authorized access into 'exceeding authorized access' under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2).\n\nWe hold that it does not. As we held in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn, 'access' must be understood in terms of traditional computer authorization, such as authentication credentials or IP blocking. Terms of service alone cannot convert permissible access into a federal crime.\n\nDefendant’s conviction is REVERSED.`

        fullText: `SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n\nM-123/September Term 2021\n\nDAVIS, Petitioner,\nv.\nMETROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY, Respondent.\n\nArgued January 10, 2022 — Decided August 11, 2022\n\nPatterson, J. We consider whether a transit police officer may recover workers’ compensation benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after responding to a fatal subway accident, despite suffering no physical injury.\n\nWe overrule the physical impact requirement for mental-health claims by first responders. The traumatic nature of such events, combined with the duty to confront them, justifies a special rule: a first responder who develops PTSD as a result of a sudden, extraordinary workplace event is entitled to compensation, regardless of physical trauma.\n\nThe Appellate Division’s judgment is reversed.`
