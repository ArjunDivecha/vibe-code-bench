This misdiagnosis allegedly delayed treatment by eight months, during which time the cancer metastasized.\n\nExpert testimony was presented by both parties. Dr. Emily Chen, testifying for the plaintiff, stated that the tumor was "readily identifiable" on the imaging studies. Dr. Robert Kim, for the defense, argued that the lesion was ambiguous and within the range of normal variants.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $4.2 million in compensatory damages. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied.\n\nWe affirm the judgment of the court below. The evidence supports the jury's finding that Dr. Smith deviated from the accepted standard of care.\n\nDate: May 15, 2023\nChief Justice: Margaret Baxter`

The charges stem from a series of over 200 anonymous emails sent to victim Sarah Lin between June and December 2020.\n\nThe emails contained detailed threats of physical violence, including references to the victim's daily routines and workplace. The defendant was identified through IP address tracing and metadata analysis.\n\nAt trial, the defense argued that the messages were fictional writing and not intended to be perceived as credible threats. The prosecution introduced evidence of the emotional distress suffered by the victim, including diagnosis of PTSD.\n\nThe jury convicted the defendant on all counts. The Appellate Division affirmed.\n\nWe hold that the totality of circumstances—including specificity of threats, persistence of communication, and impact on the victim—supports the jury's conclusion that the communications constituted credible threats.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nDecided: November 30, 2022\nJudge: Patricia O'Donnell`

The appellee contends it is overbroad and infringes on core political speech.\n\nWe conclude that while the government has a compelling interest in protecting critical infrastructure, the 100-foot radius is not narrowly tailored. Less restrictive alternatives, such as enhanced security or temporary restrictions based on specific threats, are available.\n\nThe judgment below is affirmed.\n\nDecided: January 18, 2023\nChief Justice: Daniel Reeves`

The Court of Appeals reversed.\n\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court's decision.\n\nUnder the ABC test set forth in RCW 49.52.005(2), the employer bears the burden of proving: (A) the worker is free from control; (B) the work is outside the usual course of business; and (C) the worker is customarily engaged in an independent business.\n\nAmazon fails prong B: delivering packages is central to its business model.

Neurological symptoms, including seizures and developmental regression, emerged between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe trial court dismissed the claims as time-barred under N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2, which generally provides a two-year limitations period. The Appellate Division affirmed.\n\nWe reverse. Under the discovery rule, the limitations period begins when the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of the injury and its connection to the defendant's conduct.\n\nIn cases involving latent injuries from pharmaceuticals, the onset of symptoms does not necessarily equate to discovery of causation. Here, medical consensus on the link between Neurovax and neurological damage was not established until 2021.\n\nThe complaint was filed within two years of that determination.\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\nDecided: December 8, 2022\nJustice: Robert Caldwell`

While automated scanning using algorithms may be permissible, any human review of communications clearly marked as attorney-client privileged must be accompanied by a warrant or judicial authorization, absent emergency conditions.\n\nThe automated flagging of such communications based on recipient address alone creates an unacceptable risk of intrusion into privileged discourse.\n\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n\nDecided: February 16, 2023\nCircuit Judge: Anita Patel`

Under the agreement, Pfizer provided proprietary antigen designs and adjuvant technology, while BioSecure contributed mRNA delivery systems.\n\nThe joint project was terminated in August 2021. Three months later, BioSecure announced a competing vaccine using an antigen sequence nearly identical to Pfizer's.\n\nPfizer sued, alleging breach of the confidentiality provisions and misappropriation under the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n\nAfter a four-day evidentiary hearing, I find for the plaintiff. BioSecure's scientists had access to Pfizer's designs. The sequence similarity is beyond coincidence.
