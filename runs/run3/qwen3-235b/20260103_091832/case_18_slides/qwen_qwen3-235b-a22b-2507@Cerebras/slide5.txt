Machine Learning Basics
Machine learning enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

Main types:
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning

Common algorithms:
• Linear regression
• Decision trees
• Random forests
• Support vector machines
• Neural networks

Model evaluation metrics vary by task:
- Accuracy, precision, recall for classification
- RMSE, MAE for regression
