Data Preprocessing
Raw data is rarely ready for analysis. Preprocessing transforms raw data into a usable format.

Common preprocessing steps:
1. Handling missing values
2. Removing duplicates
3. Data type conversion
4. Outlier detection and treatment
5. Normalization and scaling

Data cleaning can take 60-80% of a data science project's time.
Investing in robust preprocessing leads to more reliable results.
