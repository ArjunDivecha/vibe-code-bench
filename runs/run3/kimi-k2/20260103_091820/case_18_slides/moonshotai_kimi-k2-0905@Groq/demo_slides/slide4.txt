Feature Engineering Techniques
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

Key techniques:
• One-hot encoding for categorical variables
• Scaling and normalization
• Polynomial features
• Time-based features
• Domain-specific transformations

Good features often matter more than complex algorithms.
