Model Evaluation Metrics
Evaluating model performance is crucial for understanding how well our algorithms work.

Common metrics:
• Accuracy - Overall correctness
• Precision - True positives among predicted positives
• Recall - True positives among actual positives
• F1-Score - Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Choosing the right metric depends on your specific use case and business requirements.
