Supervised Learning Algorithms
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions on new, unseen data.

Popular algorithms include:
• Linear Regression
• Decision Trees
• Random Forests
• Support Vector Machines
• Neural Networks

Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems.
