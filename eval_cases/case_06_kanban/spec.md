# Build me a Kanban Board

I want a simple Kanban board like Trello:

- Three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
- I can add new cards with a title
- Drag and drop cards between columns
- Click a card to edit or delete it
- Cards should have different colors for priority (red=urgent, yellow=medium, green=low)
- Save everything to localStorage

Make it work with just HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks needed.
