# Build me a Color Palette Generator

Create a color palette tool:

- Generate random 5-color palettes
- Click any color to copy its hex code
- Lock colors you like (they stay when generating new ones)
- Show color codes (hex, rgb)
- Maybe name suggestions for colors
- Save favorite palettes to localStorage
- Press spacebar to generate new palette

Smooth animations and transitions. Single HTML file.
