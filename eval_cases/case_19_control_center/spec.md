# Build me a Project Control Center

Create a high-end web dashboard that looks like a native desktop application:

**Aesthetics:**
- Glassmorphism (blurred backgrounds, subtle borders)
- Vertical sidebar with active/hover states
- Main area with "Widgets" (cards)
- Smooth micro-animations on hover

**Widgets to Include:**
- **Active Projects**: A list of cards with progress bars
- **Recent Activity**: A vertical timeline of events
- **Quick Links**: Grid of icons for common tools
- **Task List**: Mini to-do list with checkboxes

**Interactivity:**
- Sidebar allows "switching" views (Home, Projects, Settings) - use JS to swap content without reload
- Add a "New Project" button that pops up a clean modal
- Persist tasks in localStorage

Single HTML file, pure CSS/JS. Make it feel "Premium".
