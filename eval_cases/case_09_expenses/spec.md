# Build me an Expense Tracker

I need a personal expense tracker web app:

- Add expenses with: amount, category, description, date
- Categories: Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Shopping, Other
- Show list of all expenses
- Filter by category or date range
- Show total spending and breakdown by category
- Maybe a simple pie chart for categories
- Store in localStorage

Single HTML file with nice, clean design.
