# Build me a Quiz App

Create an interactive quiz game as a web page. I want:

- A start screen with a "Begin Quiz" button
- 10 trivia questions (make up fun ones about random topics)
- Multiple choice with 4 options each
- Show one question at a time
- Highlight if I got it right or wrong after clicking
- Keep track of my score
- At the end, show my final score and let me play again
- Some nice animations would be cool

Single HTML file please, with everything embedded.
