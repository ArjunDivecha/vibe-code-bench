# Build me a Pomodoro Timer

I want a simple pomodoro timer web page. When I open it in my browser:

- There's a big countdown display showing 25:00
- A Start button to begin the timer
- The timer counts down second by second
- When it hits 0, it plays a sound (use a beep) and switches to a 5-minute break
- After the break, it goes back to 25 minutes
- Show which session I'm on (Work 1, Break 1, Work 2, etc.)
- Let me pause and reset

Just make it a single HTML file I can open in my browser. Make it look nice with some CSS - maybe a tomato red theme since it's pomodoro.
