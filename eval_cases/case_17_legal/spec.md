# Build me a Legal Case Search Workspace

Create a single-file interactive web application for "Vibe-Law":

**Features:**
- A search bar to "query" case law
- A results list showing mock cases (Title, Court, Date, Preview Snippet)
- Clicking a case opens a "Detail View" (split pane or modal)
- In the Detail View:
  - Show a "Summary" tab and a "Full Text" tab
  - "Extract Entities" button (simulated: highlights names/dates in text)
  - "Notes" sidebar where I can save specific snippets (using localStorage)
- Visual Style: Very professional, "Dark mode legal" (deep blues/charcoals), high-density information but clean.

**Rules:**
- Interactive single HTML file
- Mock 10-15 legal cases in JavaScript
- No external libraries
