# Build me a Note Taking App

Create a simple notes app as a web page:

- I can create new notes with a title and content
- Notes are saved to localStorage so they persist
- I can see all my notes in a list/grid
- Click a note to view/edit it
- Delete notes I don't need
- Search through my notes
- Maybe some basic formatting (bold, italic)

Make it clean and minimal. Single HTML file.
