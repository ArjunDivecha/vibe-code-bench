# Build me a Habit Tracker

I want to track daily habits:

- Add habits (like "Exercise", "Read", "Meditate")
- Each day, check off which habits I completed
- See a calendar/grid view of the past 30 days
- Streak counter for each habit
- Completion percentage
- Save to localStorage

Simple, motivating design. Single HTML file.
