# Build me a Git Stats Infographic Generator

Create a Python script that:

1. Recursively scans the current directory
2. Calculates:
   - File count by extension
   - Total lines of code
   - Largest files
   - Directory depth
3. Generates a **beautiful, single-file HTML infographic** (`stats.html`)
   - Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for a modern dashboard layout
   - Use inline SVG for charts (pie chart for file types, bar chart for line counts)
   - Dark mode aesthetic (vibrant colors on dark background)
   - Title: "Codebase Fingerprint"

**Rules:**
- Use ONLY Python 3 standard library
- No external JS libraries (write vanilla JS for any interactions)
- Single Python file that outputs a single HTML file
