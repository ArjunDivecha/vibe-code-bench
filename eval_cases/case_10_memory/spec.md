# Build me a Memory Card Game

Create a memory matching game:

- Grid of face-down cards (like 4x4 = 16 cards = 8 pairs)
- Click to flip cards
- If two cards match, they stay face up
- If they don't match, flip back after a second
- Count moves and time
- Win when all pairs found
- Show final stats and play again button
- Use emojis or symbols for the card faces

Fun animations please! Single HTML file.
