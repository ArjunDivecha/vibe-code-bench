# Build me a Calculator

I need a calculator web app that looks like a real calculator:

- Number buttons 0-9
- Operations: +, -, ×, ÷
- Clear button (C) and equals (=)
- Decimal point
- A nice display showing the current input and result
- Keyboard support would be nice
- Handle stuff like dividing by zero gracefully
- Make it look sleek and modern

One HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
