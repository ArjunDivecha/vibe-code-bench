# Build me a Weather Dashboard

Create a weather display page with mock data (don't need real API):

- Show weather for 5 cities (New York, London, Tokyo, Sydney, Paris)
- Each city shows: temperature, condition (sunny/cloudy/rainy), humidity
- Nice weather icons or emojis for each condition
- Click a city to see more details
- Maybe a simple chart showing temperatures across cities
- Change the background color based on conditions
- Make it responsive for mobile

Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS and hardcoded weather data.
